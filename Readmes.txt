#Types of Testing(Devs perspective)
- Unit Testing : When we test small unit of our project like a component is known as unit testing. Means testing one unit in isolation is known as unit testing
- Integration Testing : This type of testing is when multiple components are involved to each other and makes a flow so we test it like that. 
- End To End Tessting : Test for each case of the application. It requires diffrent type of tools like cyprus , selenium.

But as a developer we are concerned about first two type of testing.
